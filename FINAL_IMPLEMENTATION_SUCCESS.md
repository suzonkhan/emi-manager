## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: TypeError in CustomerRepository (FIXED ✅)
**Error**: 
```
App\Services\RoleHierarchyService::canAssignRole(): Argument #1 ($user) must be of type App\Models\User, string given
```

**Root Cause**: 
Line 101 in `CustomerRepository.php` was passing `$user->role` and `$customer->creator->role` as strings, but `canAssignRole()` expects a User object and a role name string.

**Fix Applied**:
```php
// Before (WRONG):
return $this->roleHierarchyService->canAssignRole($user->role, $customer->creator->role);

// After (CORRECT):
$creatorRole = $customer->creator->getRoleNames()->first();
if ($creatorRole) {
    return $this->roleHierarchyService->canAssignRole($user, $creatorRole);
}
```

**File**: `app/Repositories/Customer/CustomerRepository.php` (Lines 99-107)

---

### Issue 2: Nested Relationships Not Loaded (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Address relationships (division, district, upazilla) were not being loaded, causing null values in the details page.

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `CustomerRepository::findById()` to eager load nested relationships:
```php
return Customer::with([
    'presentAddress.division',
    'presentAddress.district',
    'presentAddress.upazilla',
    'permanentAddress.division',
    'permanentAddress.district',
    'permanentAddress.upazilla',
    'token',
    'creator'
])->find($id);
```

**File**: `app/Repositories/Customer/CustomerRepository.php` (Lines 23-35)

---

### Issue 3: Creator Role Access (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: `CustomerDetailResource` was trying to access `$this->creator->role` directly, but User model uses Spatie's HasRoles trait.

**Fix Applied**:
```php
// Before (WRONG):
'role' => $this->creator->role,

// After (CORRECT):
'role' => $this->creator->getRoleNames()->first(),
```

**File**: `app/Http/Resources/CustomerDetailResource.php` (Line 61)
