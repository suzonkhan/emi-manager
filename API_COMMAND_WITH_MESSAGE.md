# Device Command with Message Display API

## üéØ Purpose

This API allows you to **trigger a device command** (like lock, unlock, disable camera, etc.) **AND automatically show a custom message** on the device screen after the command executes.

Perfect for showing user-friendly notifications like:
- "Device locked due to missed payment"
- "Camera disabled temporarily"
- "Your EMI payment is due tomorrow"

## üîÑ How It Works (Backend Flow)

```
1. API receives request
   ‚Üì
2. Validates customer_id and command
   ‚Üì
3. Executes primary command (lock, unlock, etc.)
   ‚Üì
4. If command succeeds AND display_message is provided:
   ‚Üì
5. Sends SHOW_MESSAGE command via FCM
   ‚Üì
6. Device receives both commands:
   - First: Execute primary command
   - Second: Show message notification
   ‚Üì
7. Returns combined response
```

---

## üì± Mobile App Integration

### For Android Developers

Your Android app will receive **2 FCM push notifications**:

#### 1. Primary Command Notification
```json
{
  "command": "LOCK_DEVICE",
  "customer_id": 123,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T14:30:00Z"
}
```

#### 2. Message Display Notification
```json
{
  "command": "SHOW_MESSAGE",
  "customer_id": 123,
  "title": "Device Locked",
  "message": "Your device has been locked due to missed EMI payment.",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T14:30:01Z"
}
```

### Handling in Android App

```kotlin
// In your FirebaseMessagingService
override fun onMessageReceived(remoteMessage: RemoteMessage) {
    val command = remoteMessage.data["command"]
    
    when (command) {
        "LOCK_DEVICE" -> {
            // Lock the device
            deviceManager.lockDevice()
        }
        "SHOW_MESSAGE" -> {
            // Show notification/dialog
            val title = remoteMessage.data["title"]
            val message = remoteMessage.data["message"]
            showNotification(title, message)
        }
        // ... other commands
    }
}
```

## üÜö Comparison: Regular Command vs Command with Message

### Regular Command Endpoint
```
POST /api/devices/command/lock
{
  "customer_id": 123
}

Result:
‚úì Device locked
‚úó No message shown to user
```

### Command with Message Endpoint
```
POST /api/devices/command-with-message/lock
{
  "customer_id": 123,
  "display_message": "Device locked due to missed payment",
  "display_title": "Device Locked"
}

Result:
‚úì Device locked
‚úì Message shown to user
```
