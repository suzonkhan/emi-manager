## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue 1: 500 Error on Customer Details/Edit Pages
**Problem**: When accessing `/customers/:id` or `/customers/edit/:id`, the API returns a 500 Internal Server Error.

**Root Cause**: The `CustomerDetailResource` is trying to access `$this->creator->role` but the User model doesn't have a direct `role` attribute. It uses Spatie's HasRoles trait.

**Attempted Fix**: Changed line 61 in `CustomerDetailResource.php` from:
```php
'role' => $this->creator->role,
```
to:
```php
'role' => $this->creator->getRoleNames()->first(),
```

**Status**: Fix applied but still getting 500 error. Need to investigate further.

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Check if there are other places in CustomerDetailResource accessing non-existent properties
2. Verify that all relationships are properly loaded
3. Check Laravel logs for the exact error message
4. Test the API endpoint directly with curl/Postman to see the error response

### Issue 2: Nested Relationships Not Loaded
**Problem**: Address relationships (division, district, upazilla) might not be loaded properly.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `CustomerRepository::findById()` to eager load nested relationships:
```php
return Customer::with([
    'presentAddress.division',
    'presentAddress.district',
    'presentAddress.upazilla',
    'permanentAddress.division',
    'permanentAddress.district',
    'permanentAddress.upazilla',
    'token',
    'creator'
])->find($id);
```

**Status**: Applied but needs testing once the 500 error is resolved.

## üîß Next Steps to Fix Issues

### Priority 1: Fix 500 Error
1. **Check Laravel Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```
   Or check the latest log file in `storage/logs/`

2. **Test API Directly**:
   ```bash
   # Get auth token first
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"admin@emimanager.com","password":"password"}'
   
   # Test customer details endpoint
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/customers/211
   ```

3. **Review CustomerDetailResource**:
   - Check all property accesses
   - Verify all relationships exist
   - Add null checks where needed

4. **Possible Fix in CustomerDetailResource**:
   ```php
   'creator' => $this->whenLoaded('creator', function () {
       return $this->creator ? [
           'id' => $this->creator->id,
           'name' => $this->creator->name,
           'email' => $this->creator->email,
           'phone' => $this->creator->phone,
           'role' => $this->creator->roles->first()?->name ?? null,
       ] : null;
   }),
   ```

### Priority 2: Test All Functionality
Once the 500 error is fixed:
1. Test customer details page
2. Test edit page with pre-filled data
3. Test form submission on edit page

## üéØ Summary

The customer management system has been successfully converted from modal-based to page-based navigation. The list and add pages are fully functional. However, there's a 500 error when accessing customer details or edit pages that needs to be resolved. The issue is related to accessing the `role` property on the User model in the CustomerDetailResource.

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix the 500 error by properly accessing the user's role through Spatie's HasRoles trait methods.

**Estimated Time to Fix**: 15-30 minutes once the exact error is identified from Laravel logs.
